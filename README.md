A small Win7/Mil9 app for exploring the image processing chain for VisualSpreadsheet.

The project settings expect to find the Mil9 include and libraries in the following
relative location from this project

../FlowCAMSoftware/Mil9/

So the easiest thing to do is clone this project at the same level as FlowCAMSoftware
on your machine.
